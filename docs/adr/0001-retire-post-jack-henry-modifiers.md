# ADR-0001 — Retire modifiers added after the Jack Henry era

## Status

Adopted — 2026-07-30. The listed modifiers are deprecated and will be removed
in a future breaking release. This record remains the inventory of their
retirement.

## Decision

**Deprecate and remove the modifiers in the retirement inventory below. Keep
FDL's public modifier vocabulary limited to reusable field and record behavior,
or stable presentation intent that independent consumers can interpret. Put
browser attributes, control selection, component contracts, lifecycle behavior,
and view-specific layout in the renderer or its integration layer instead.**

When a future modifier is deprecated or removed, update this ADR in the same
change. A deprecation adds an inventory entry; a removal changes that entry's
status to `Removed` and records the release or date.

## Context

FDL is a language for fields, records, and recordsets, not a configuration bag
for a particular form component. Modifiers added after the original Jack Henry
work expanded `FieldType` with browser attributes, renderer-private flags,
component exceptions, and event-oriented hooks. These modifiers encode how one
control should be built or behave rather than what a field means.

That expansion conflicts with FDL's architecture: business rules flow to
semantic state, then to accessible components, then to visual presentation.
It also creates contracts that cannot be enforced by `FieldType`, `Record`, or
`Recordset`, are not portable to other renderers, and make the public API larger
without expanding the reusable modeling language.

## Applicable principles

- Keep business rules, UI semantics, and visual presentation orthogonal.
- Keep modifiers declarative, composable, renderer-independent, and testable
  without a production UI.
- Enforce model behavior in FDL rather than forwarding a browser or component
  property as a substitute for a rule.
- Prefer callbacks and compact configuration for application behavior over a
  new public modifier for each control-specific need.

See [FDL design principles](../design-principles.md).

## Options considered

1. Retain every modifier for backward compatibility. This preserves existing
   call sites but treats component-specific configuration as permanent FDL
   semantics and prolongs an incoherent API.
2. Add more generic pass-through modifiers. This would reduce naming pressure,
   but would explicitly turn `FieldType` into renderer configuration and make
   its contract even less portable.
3. Deprecate the misplaced modifiers, provide renderer- or model-level
   replacements where appropriate, and remove them in the next breaking
   release. **Chosen.**

## Consequences

Consumers must move presentation and control configuration to the renderer or
form adapter. Some former shortcuts no longer have an FDL-level replacement;
that is intentional when the behavior is not reusable model behavior.

FDL gains a smaller, more durable public vocabulary. Its modifiers become easier
to understand, test, and render consistently in forms, tables, documents, and
other consumers. The explicit inventory makes removals auditable and prevents
future retirement work from losing historical context.

## Advice

- 2026-07-30 — Repository maintainer: align the modifier surface with the
  documented FDL vision and preserve a complete removal inventory in this ADR.

## Modifier retirement inventory

| Modifier | Status | Replacement or destination | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `accept` | Deprecated | Renderer-specific input configuration | Browser input attribute; not model validation. |
| `additionalProperties` | Deprecated | Renderer integration | Arbitrary renderer-property pass-through. |
| `autocomplete` | Deprecated | Renderer-specific input configuration | Browser interaction hint. |
| `autofocus` | Deprecated | Renderer-specific input configuration | Focus behavior belongs to the component. |
| `field` | Deprecated | Record/renderer binding | View binding alias, not field behavior. |
| `filtering` | Deprecated | Renderer-specific option-control configuration | Interactive option-control behavior is not reusable field behavior. |
| `formElement` | Deprecated | Renderer integration | Component selection and private properties. |
| `formatOnChange` | Deprecated | Renderer and value pipeline | Input-event formatting policy. |
| `hasSearch` | Deprecated | `search(config)` | Redundant shorthand for search configuration. |
| `hideLabel` | Deprecated | Renderer | Label visibility is presentation. |
| `iconMessage` | Deprecated | Renderer | Tooltip presentation is renderer-specific. |
| `inline` | Deprecated | View and CSS | Layout instruction. |
| `inlineWhen` | Deprecated | View and CSS | Conditional layout instruction. |
| `list` | Deprecated | Renderer-specific input configuration | Browser input attribute. |
| `max` | Deprecated | Model validation or renderer input configuration | Browser constraint is not model-enforced. |
| `onValueChange` | Deprecated | Record or application model | Imperative cross-field orchestration. |
| `parseDynamicRange` | Deprecated | `parser(...)` | Parsing belongs in the value pipeline. |
| `pattern` | Deprecated | Model validation or renderer input configuration | Browser constraint is not model-enforced. |
| `readOnlyExceptionWhen` | Deprecated | Renderer | Composite-control exception. |
| `schema` | Deprecated | Application metadata outside `FieldType` | Legacy metadata without reusable field behavior. |
| `selectionDisabledFunctions` | Deprecated | Renderer or form adapter | Individual choice disabling is renderer-specific and is not enforced by the FDL model or native controls. |
| `segmented` | Deprecated | Renderer-specific control configuration | Control presentation choice. |
| `step` | Deprecated | Renderer-specific input configuration | Browser input attribute. |
| `tag` | Deprecated | Renderer-specific control configuration | HTML/control selection. |
| `usesCustomPrint` | Deprecated | Renderer | Custom print behavior. |

### Inventory maintenance

Do not delete rows from this table. For each future deprecation, add a row in
alphabetical order with status `Deprecated`. When the API is removed, change
that row to `Removed — <release or date>` and revise its destination if the
migration path changed.
