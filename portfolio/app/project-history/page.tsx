                  The repository already contained the central FDL idea:
                  declarative field types, immutable-looking builder syntax,
                  record and recordset models, validation, dependencies,
                  formatting, filtering, and a Lit-oriented form integration.
                  That foundation is not presented as newly invented work.

                  Recent repository work clarifies the separation between model
                  behavior, component semantics, and presentation. It restores a
                  unified <code>&lt;fdl-field&gt;</code> example boundary and begins
                  deprecating modifiers that encode browser attributes,
                  component exceptions, or event orchestration in the model.

                  The current portfolio work reframes the library around a
                  concrete ACH and child-support workflow: define a rule once,
                  then observe form, validation, review, and output consumers.
                  Reference material remains available, but it no longer has to
                  carry the first impression.

                  Planned work includes removing the Lit runtime dependency in

              AI can accelerate repository exploration, option generation,
              boilerplate, and focused implementation. It does not establish

              behavior and presentation.
